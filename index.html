        <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines.
          It enables computers to perform tasks like learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.
          AI includes fields like machine learning, natural language processing, and robotics.
          It powers tools like voice assistants, self-driving cars, and recommendation systems.
          AI learns from data to improve its performance over time without explicit programming.
          It helps automate repetitive tasks and uncover insights at scale.
          While powerful, ethical use and human oversight of AI are essential for its future.

        <p>Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn from data.
          Instead of being explicitly programmed, ML models improve through experience.
          It identifies patterns and makes predictions or decisions based on input data.
          There are different types like supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.
          ML powers spam filters, recommendation engines, fraud detection, and more.
          The more data it gets, the smarter and more accurate it becomes.
          ML is transforming industries by enabling automation and smarter decision-making.

        <p>Quantum computing is a new type of computing based on the principles of quantum physics.
          It uses quantum bits or qubits, which can be in multiple states at once (thanks to superposition).
          Qubits can also be entangled, allowing powerful parallel processing beyond classical computers.
          Quantum computers excel at solving certain problems much faster than traditional machines.
          They’re being explored for use in cryptography, drug discovery, optimization, and AI.
          Still in early stages, they require extreme conditions like near-zero temperatures to operate.
          Quantum computing holds massive potential—but it’s still more lab coat than laptop.

        <p>Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—like servers, storage, and databases—over the internet.
          It lets users access powerful resources without owning physical hardware.
          You pay only for what you use, like a utility (electricity, but for computing!).
          There are three main types: IaaS (Infrastructure), PaaS (Platform), and SaaS (Software).
          Popular providers include AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.
          It enables scalability, flexibility, remote work, and fast innovation.
          From Netflix streaming to online backups—cloud computing is everywhere!.

        <p>Cryptography is the science of securing information by transforming it into unreadable formats.
          It protects data using techniques like encryption and decryption.
          Only authorized parties with the right key can access the original message.
          It’s crucial for secure communication, banking, and online privacy.
          There are two main types: symmetric (same key) and asymmetric (public/private keys).
          Modern cryptography powers technologies like HTTPS, VPNs, and blockchain.
          In a world full of hackers, cryptography is like the digital invisibility cloak.
